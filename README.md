# About Steve
Honestly, I just wanted to build a robot.  

When I started the project, my only goal was to build something that moved. As time went on, I decided I wanted to add to that. I started adding sensors, software, eventually a camera.

Somewhere along the line, a friend of mine said it was only cool if it could fetch me a beer. That got me thinking, and it has since sculpted a direction for Steve going forward. 

Right now, Steve has as output, two screens, a camera, a treaded chassis that runs on DC motors, and a status light inside the chassis. As input, he has a thermometer, a sound sensor, a light sensor and a front-mounted ultrasonic range-finder. 

I hope some day to incorporate Image Recognition and Voice Commands. However, OpenCV is fighting me, and the sound hardware on raspberry pi is difficult to use.

OPENCV is working

A more in-depth writeup is in progress.
